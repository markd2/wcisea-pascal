# Writing Compilers and Interpreters

My colleague [Rafa](https://github.com/ralphie9224) turned me on to the
Ronald Mak "Writing Compilers and Interpreters: A Software Engineering Approach"
_(and here I thought AMOXP:TBNRG had a redonkulously long title)_.  
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Compilers-Interpreters-Software-Engineering/dp/0470177071/)

Rafa is working through it, but rather than in the Java of the book, is doing it
in Kotlin.  It sounds like a cool idea, so I'm going to try it Swift-styles.

I may finish the book. I may get bored after two chapters.  The last-mod-date
of this repo shall be a testament to my shame.
